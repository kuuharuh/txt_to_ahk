# txt_to_ahk
simple executable that converts a txt file to an ahk script that writes the text when pressing F2 (for situations where you can't copy and paste)

needs AutoHotKey v1.0

# download

just download the executable

# use

it has two ways of use

first, you can drag a text file to the executable and it will create the .ahk file with the same name

but you can also just open the executable and it will ask you for the text. it will give you the result on a file named "result.ahk"
